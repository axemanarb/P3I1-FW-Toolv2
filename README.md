Version 2 of the P3/Inspire1 FW Tool.

This tool makes it easy to leverage the Python scripts other OG's have created. Download the BAT file and the download.jar file into the same folder. Run the BAT file.

This will look for any P3/Inspire1 .BIN file in that folder. It will then extract the 
firmware, extract the flight controller and edit the parameters in notepad. After saving/
closing the file, it will re-compile the firmware.
